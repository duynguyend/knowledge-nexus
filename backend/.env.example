# --- LLM Configuration ---
# The system prioritizes Azure OpenAI. If Azure credentials are not fully provided or are invalid,
# it will attempt to fall back to using the standard OpenAI API key.
# For full LLM functionality (synthesis, document generation), at least one of these configurations
# (either all required Azure details OR the standard OpenAI API key) must be correctly set.
# If neither is configured, the system will run in a degraded mode using simulated LLM responses.

# --- Azure OpenAI Credentials ---
# To use Azure OpenAI, ALL of the following variables related to chat/language models must be set correctly.
# These credentials are used for accessing Azure OpenAI services, including language models.
# Replace "YOUR_..." placeholders with your actual Azure OpenAI service details.

# API Key for your Azure OpenAI Language Models (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4).
# This is the key used for services like chat completions.
