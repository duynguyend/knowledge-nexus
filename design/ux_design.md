# Knowledge Nexus: UX Design Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the User Experience (UX) design for the Knowledge Nexus application. Knowledge Nexus is a multi-agent AI application designed to provide users with thoroughly researched, verified, and professionally presented knowledge on any given topic. It automates internet research, data verification (with human oversight), knowledge storage, content synthesis, and tailored document generation. It serves as the core knowledge acquisition, synthesis, and conflict detection component.

The goal of this UX design is to create an intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly interface that empowers users to easily acquire, synthesize, and manage knowledge.

## 2. User Personas (Hypothetical)

**Persona Name:** Dr. Anya Sharma
**Role:** Academic Researcher / Consultant
**Goals:**
*   Quickly gather comprehensive and verified information on niche topics.
*   Synthesize large volumes of data into coherent, well-structured documents.
*   Ensure the accuracy and reliability of information.
*   Generate tailored reports for different audiences (e.g., academic papers, client briefings).
**Pain Points:**
*   Time-consuming manual research and data verification.
*   Difficulty in managing and organizing vast amounts of information.
*   Challenges in synthesizing disparate sources into a unified narrative.
*   Need for human oversight to ensure quality and detect conflicts.

## 3. User Flows

The primary user flow involves initiating a research task, monitoring its progress, reviewing synthesized content, selecting output formats, and exporting the final document.

### 3.1. Initiate Research & View Progress

1.  **Home Screen (`home.html`)**: User inputs a research query/topic.
2.  **Research Progress Screen (`research_progress.html`)**: User monitors the real-time progress of the AI agents (research, verification, synthesis). Displays status, current sub-tasks, and potentially preliminary findings.

### 3.2. Review & Refine Synthesis

1.  **Synthesis Screen (`synthesis.html`)**: Presents the initial synthesized knowledge. Users can read, highlight, and potentially add notes or request further synthesis/refinement.
2.  **Review Dashboard (`review.html`)**: Allows users to review the synthesized content, identify potential conflicts or inaccuracies, and provide feedback or corrections. This is where human oversight is integrated.

### 3.3. Select Output & Export

1.  **Select Output Screen (`select_output.html`)**: User chooses the desired output format (e.g., PDF, Word, Markdown) and document structure/template.
2.  **Export Options Screen (`export.html`)**: User configures final export settings (e.g., file name, destination, inclusion of sources).

## 4. Information Architecture

The application's information architecture is structured around the core workflow of knowledge acquisition and synthesis.

*   **Dashboard/Home**: Central entry point for new research tasks and overview of ongoing/completed projects.
*   **Research Management**: Section for tracking and managing individual research projects.
*   **Content Review**: Dedicated area for human oversight, verification, and conflict resolution.
*   **Output & Export**: Tools for customizing and generating final knowledge documents.
*   **Settings/Profile**: User preferences and account management.

## 5. Screen Descriptions

    *   Reference/source links integrated with the content.
    *   "Proceed to Review" button.

### 5.4. Review Dashboard (`review.html`)

*   **Purpose**: Facilitate human review, verification, and conflict resolution.
*   **Key Elements**:
    *   Side-by-side view of synthesized content and original sources (or flagged sections).
    *   Tools for:
        *   Accepting/rejecting synthesized statements.
        *   Flagging inaccuracies or conflicts.
        *   Adding manual corrections or annotations.
        *   Assigning verification tasks to human experts.
    *   Conflict resolution interface (e.g., showing conflicting statements from different sources).
    *   "Approve & Continue" or "Request Re-synthesis" options.

### 5.5. Select Output Screen (`select_output.html`)

*   **Purpose**: Allow users to choose the desired output format and structure.
*   **Key Elements**:
    *   Options for document format (e.g., PDF, DOCX, Markdown, HTML).
    *   Template selection (e.g., "Academic Report," "Executive Summary," "Blog Post").
    *   Preview of how the selected template affects the content.
    *   Options to include/exclude specific sections or appendices (e.g., "Include References," "Include Research Methodology").
    *   "Configure Export" or "Next" button.

### 5.6. Export Options Screen (`export.html`)

*   **Purpose**: Finalize export settings before generating the document.

## 6. Interaction Design Principles

*   **Clarity**: All actions and information should be clear and unambiguous.
*   **Consistency**: Maintain consistent UI elements, terminology, and interaction patterns across the application.
*   **Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions (e.g., loading indicators, success messages, error alerts).
*   **Efficiency**: Streamline workflows to minimize user effort and time.
*   **Control**: Users should feel in control of the process, with options to pause, cancel, or revert actions.
*   **Forgiveness**: Allow users to easily correct mistakes or undo actions.

## 7. Accessibility Considerations

*   **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard.
*   **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes to provide meaningful context for screen readers.
*   **Color Contrast**: Adhere to WCAG guidelines for sufficient color contrast to ensure readability.
*   **Resizable Text**: Allow users to adjust text size without loss of content or functionality.
*   **Descriptive Alt Text**: Provide meaningful `alt` text for all images and non-text content.

## 8. Future Considerations

*   **Project Management**: Features for organizing multiple research projects, tagging, and archiving.
*   **Collaboration Tools**: Ability for multiple users to collaborate on research and review.
*   **Customizable Agents**: Options for advanced users to configure AI agent behaviors or integrate custom data sources.
*   **Version History**: Tracking changes and revisions of synthesized documents.
