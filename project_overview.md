## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Knowledge Nexus

**Main Purpose:** Knowledge Nexus is a multi-agent AI application designed to provide users with thoroughly researched, verified, and professionally presented knowledge on any given topic.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Automated Internet Research:** Leverages advanced AI agents to scour the internet for relevant information.
- **Data Verification with Human Oversight:** Incorporates a robust data verification process, enhanced by human oversight, to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Knowledge Storage:** Efficiently stores researched and verified information, creating a rich and organized knowledge base.
- **Content Synthesis:** AI agents excel at synthesizing disparate pieces of information into coherent, well-structured content.
- **Tailored Document Generation:** Generates customized documents based on the synthesized knowledge in various formats.

**Problem Solved:** In an age of information overload and rampant misinformation, Knowledge Nexus addresses a critical need for reliable and trustworthy knowledge. By combining the speed and efficiency of AI with the critical judgment of human oversight, it offers an unparalleled solution for accessing verified information.

**Important Note on Project Structure:**
An older directory named `knowledge_nexus/` exists at the root of the repository. This directory contains outdated or redundant code and should be ignored for active development. The primary codebase resides in the top-level `backend/` and `frontend/` directories. Attempts to remove or rename this legacy `knowledge_nexus/` directory were unsuccessful due to tooling limitations during a recent refactoring.
